# The massive USB.IDS list in C

The usb.ids list from [this link](http://www.linux-usb.org/usb.ids) as a structure array for use in C programs.

##How to use

To get an auto-generated source file of the current usb.ids list run the `generate_usbids.py` script with python 3.

##This doesn't include the USB device classes, subclasses, protocols and terminal types that the list contains.


These are just the Vendor IDs and Device IDs.

This code is in the public domain. It's your choice, whether you want to give me credit or not.
